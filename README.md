# A twitter bot to replace Tendermint to CometBFT

The bot runs periodically, say - every 30 minutes.

Once it encounters "Tendermint" it replaces it with "Tendermint has now been replaced by CometBFT. (And some cool space quote)"

To view what is left to be done, check [todo](https://github.com/alijnmerchant21/twitter-bot-cometbft/blob/main/todo.txt).
